# Introduction

----------

In the last chapter we talked about how to manipulate vectors and data frames in R and we also learnt various statistics that are useful to extract summary information from a dataset. With these tools we were able to answer a lot of interesting questions about the Titanic passengers by manipulating the columns of the Titanic dataset one at a time.  However, more (interesting) questions can be answered if we can use multiple columns of the dataset.  


# Read in the dataset

```{r, tidy = F}
t.ship = 
  read.csv(file = 
  '/Users/billhaarlow/Desktop/SML201/titanic.csv')
```

We should refresh our memory on the properties of the dataset.

```{r}
class(t.ship) # this tells me what kind of R object this dataset is
dim(t.ship) # 891 rows by 12 columns
```


----------


```{r}
head(t.ship) # look at the first 6 (by default) rows of an object
```

----------

```{r}
str(t.ship, strict.width = 'cut')
```

----------

**Will class or gender affect the survival rate?  How big are the gaps between the socioeconomic classes?**


----------



* What is the survival rate for each ticket class? Are the rates about the same across the three ticket classes?

```{r}
# number of survivals in each ticket class
numerator = table(t.ship$Pclass, t.ship$Survived) 
# this produces a contingency table
dim(numerator)
class(numerator)

# number of people in each ticket class
denominator = table(t.ship$Pclass) # 1-dimensional array
dim(denominator)
class(denominator)

# The following will not work since array operations
# require the two arrays to be in the same dimension
# numerator/denominator

# however, you can divide an array by a vector if the 
# dimensions make sense
table(t.ship$Pclass, t.ship$Survived)/as.vector(table(t.ship$Pclass))


# In short, you cannot operate on two arrays unless
# both arrays have exactly the same dimensions; e.g.,
# table(t.ship$Pclass, t.ship$Survived)/table(t.ship$Pclass)
```

As we can see above, the procedure gets complicated if we want to rely on using the function `table()` only.  Fortunately, there is a function `tapply()` that is suitable for this kind of tasks.  Here is how we would use the function `tapply()` to accomplish the same task.  Note that you can obtain the answer with only ONE line of code!  


```{r}
tapply(X = t.ship$Survived, INDEX = t.ship$Pclass, FUN = mean)
```





# Exercise

Question 1.  What is the survival rate for each sex? Are the rates about the same?

```{r}

tapply(t.ship$Survived, INDEX = t.ship$Sex, FUN = mean)
```

The survival rate is a lot higher for women.


Question 2.  What is the average and median price for each ticket class?

```{r}
# average prices
tapply(t.ship$Fare, INDEX = t.ship$Pclass, FUN = mean)

# how big are the gaps?
avg.tic.price = tapply(t.ship$Fare, INDEX = t.ship$Pclass, FUN = mean)
(avg.tic.price[1:2] - avg.tic.price[2:3])/avg.tic.price[2:3]
# 1st class tickets are about 3 times more than the 2nd class tickets on average
# 2st class tickets are about 150% of the 2nd class tickets on average


# median prices
tapply(t.ship$Fare, INDEX = t.ship$Pclass, FUN = median)

med.tic.price = tapply(t.ship$Fare, INDEX = t.ship$Pclass, FUN = median)
(med.tic.price[1:2] - med.tic.price[2:3])/med.tic.price[2:3]
# 1st class tickets are about 3 times more than the 2nd class tickets 
# in terms of the median
# 2st class tickets are almost 180% of the 2nd class tickets
# in terms of the median

```


# Multiple histograms

----------

**Will age affect the survival rate?**

A natural way to approach this question would be to see if there is a relationship between `Age` and the average survival rate for people of that age.  


```{r}
#  average survival rate for each age
s.rate.by.age = tapply(X = t.ship$Survived, INDEX = t.ship$Age, FUN = mean)
```

We can use a scatterplot to investigate this relationship.

```{r}
plot(x = as.numeric(names(s.rate.by.age)), y = s.rate.by.age, 
     main = 'Average Survival Rate v.s. Age',
     xlab = 'Age (in Years)', ylab = 'Average survival rate')

```
Note that this does not tell us how many people we have in each age group; thus, it is difficult to say the 100% survival rate was the result due to having too few people in the age group or not. We can try looking at the problem from a slightly different angle by answering the following question.


----------

Question 3. Can we compare the age distributions of the passengers between the survivors and the deceased?

```{r}
# histograms
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
hist(t.ship$Age[t.ship$Survived == 1], 
     freq = F, breaks = 30,
     main = 'Age Distribution of the Survivors',
     xlab = 'Age (in years)', 
     ylab = 'Proportion per year', xlim = c(0, 80))
hist(t.ship$Age[t.ship$Survived == 0], 
     freq = F, breaks = 30,
     main = 'Age Distribution of the Deceased',
     xlab = 'Age (in years)', 
     ylab = 'Proportion per year', xlim = c(0, 80))
```


# Side-by-side boxplots

Previously, we learnt how to interpret a boxplot and how to draw a boxplot for one variable.  We also learnt that a boxplot is a graphical way to display the five number summaries. Because of this a boxplot does not give us as much detailed information about the distribution of the data as a histogram; however, when comparing multiple datasets using side-by-side boxplots makes it convenient to detect any shifts in the distributions.


To make side-by-side boxplots the `boxplot()` function takes its input arguments in this form

>boxplot(y ~ grp)

where `grp` will be converted into a factor (a categorical variable) if not already so; `R` uses `grp` to divide your dataset into different groups/subsets--think about what the `INDEX` argument in `tapply()` does.


```{r}
# boxplots

par(mfrow = c(1,1))
boxplot(t.ship$Age~t.ship$Survived, 
        names = c('Deceased', 'Survived'),
        main = 'Boxplots for Age distributions of the Survivors & Deceased',
        xlab = 'Survived?',
        ylab = 'Age (in Years)')
```

# Creating functions

User-defined functions are often used to reduce the number of lines of code needed when one wants to repeat a set of task many times on different R objects.  This makes the code easier to read and reduces the chance of having errors in the code compared to using the copy-and-paste method.

```{r}
Function_name = function(input_var){
 # a set of tasks performed on the input_var
 # return(result to output)
}

RaiseToAPower = function(x, power){
  y=x^power
  return(y)
}

k = RaiseToAPower(2, 3)
k
```


Question 4. Can we create a function to calculate the survival rate and median age when users specify the gender and the ticket class of the group of passengers?

```{r}
InfoOnGenderPclass = function(gender, ticket.class){
    # `gender` options: "female" and "male";
    # `ticket.class` options: 1-3
    subs.titanic = t.ship[t.ship$Sex == gender & t.ship$Pclass == ticket.class, ]
    survival.rate = mean(subs.titanic$Survived)
    return(c(survival.rate = mean(subs.titanic$Survived), 
             median.age = median(subs.titanic$Age, na.rm = T)))
}

# run to check the output of the function
InfoOnGenderPclass(gender = "female", ticket.class = 2)
InfoOnGenderPclass(gender = "male", ticket.class = 3)

# assign output to a new variable
male3.s.rate.med.age = InfoOnGenderPclass(gender = "male", ticket.class = 3)

```




# Some interesting facts about this dataset

Someone asked in a previous lecture why the numbers for the variable `Fare` have 4 digits after the decimal.  I did some research and found out that the ticket prices were in the format of Lsd; i.e., they are in the format of Pounds-Shillings-Pence. (https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor/annie-moore-ward.html)  

Note that  

* 1 pound = 240 pence 
* 1 shilling = 12 pence 
* 1 pound = 20 shillings

Thus, in 1912 the British currency was not in the metric system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C2%A3sd).  

Also, there are discussions online about what exactly the definition for the variable `Fare` should be and there seems to be a lot of confusions.  (You can see some of the discussions here https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/3916)

After reading a few of the webpages for Titanic passengers I was able find out the definition for `Fare`.  For example, on the webpage for the passenger Ann Moore Ward (https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-survivor/annie-moore-ward.html) it says

>For the return to the USA Annie boarded the Titanic...with Mrs Cardeza, her son Thomas and his manservant Gustave Lesueur and the entourage travelled on **ticket number 17755** which cost the princely **sum** of  £512, 6s, 7d.

Thus, the figures shown for the variable `Fare` are not for individual passengers but for the group of passengers sharing the same ticket number!

We will figure out the single ticket prices ourselves.

----------

Let's create a new data frame that includes a column for the single ticket prices.  

First, let's find out how many people there are for each ticket number.

```{r}
# the output for table() is a 1-dimensional array
# however, it is much easier to work with vectors;
# thus, we want to convert the output into a vector;
# note that `as.vector()` will remove the names of 
# the elements in the table by default.

# here we want to find out the number of passengers
# for each ticket number
no.grp.members = as.vector(table(t.ship$Ticket))
head(no.grp.members)
head(table(t.ship$Ticket))
```

Note that the length of `no.grp.members` is smaller than the number of rows in `t.ship`.  Is this expected?

```{r}
# How many unque ticket numbers there are?
length(no.grp.members)

# How many passengers?
nrow(t.ship)
```


# Merging datasets

We will use the function `merge()`.  Let's create a data frame for ticket numbers and group member sizes for merging.

```{r}
ticket.member = data.frame(Ticket = names(table(t.ship$Ticket)), 
           grp.member.ct = no.grp.members)
head(ticket.member)
```

```{r}
# `by.x` is the column in `x` that is used for the matching
# `by.y` is the column in `y` that is used for the matching

t.ship.merged = merge(x = t.ship, y = ticket.member, 
                       by.x = 'Ticket', by.y = 'Ticket')

# Check that no one is missing
dim(t.ship.merged)
dim(t.ship)
```

# Adding additional columns to a data frame

```{r}
# load the package `dplyr` so that we can use 
# the function `mutate()`
library(dplyr)

t.ship.complete = mutate(t.ship.merged, single.tic.price = Fare/grp.member.ct)

knitr::kable(head(t.ship.complete))
```


# Checking the relationship between two variables

## Scatterplot

We have seen how we can investigate the relationship between two variables by using a scatterplot.  Here we would like to see if there is a relationship between the number of members sharing the same ticket number and the number of parent/sibling/spouse/child companions.


```{r}
plot(x = jitter(t.ship.complete$SibSp+t.ship.complete$Parch),
     y = jitter(t.ship.complete$grp.member.ct),
     xlab = 'Total number of parents/siblings/spouse/children',
     ylab = 'Number of members sharing the same ticket number',
     main = 'Number of members v.s. number of \n parents/siblings/spouse/children')

```

Note that the trend of the relationship between the `x` and `y` variables is somewhat linear.   

# Checking the *linear* relationship between two variables

A Correlation coefficient is a numerical measure of the strength of the **linear** relationship between two variables.  We will talk about this in more details in lecture.

-------- 

A correlation coefficient
is always between -1 and 1.  A positive value  means a directly
proportional linear relationship.  A negative correlation implies an indirectly proportional relationship.  A value close to zero implies no linear association.  A value close to 1 or -1 implies strong linear relationship.

-------- 
As an example here let's look at the relationship between the average wind speed and the maximum temperature of the day for days between May 1 and Sept 30 in 1973.

```{r fig.cap ="Scatterplot for Avg. Wind Speed v.s. Max. Temp.(May 1-Sept 30, 1973)", echo=F}
plot(y=airquality$Wind, x=airquality$Temp, main='Average Wind Speed 
     v.s. Maximum Temperature', xlab='Max. Temp (degree F) ', 
     ylab='Avg. Wind Speed (mph) ')
abline(h = mean(airquality$Wind), lty = 2, col = 'blue')
abline(v = mean(airquality$Temp), lty = 2, col = 'red')
text(x = mean(airquality$Temp), y = 2, label = 'mean(Max. Temp)', col='red')
text(y = mean(airquality$Wind), x = 62, label = 'mean(Wind Speed)', col='blue', las = 1)
text(x = c(65, 65, 88, 88), y=c(17, 7, 17, 7), cex = 3,
     label = c('(-,+)', '(-,-)', '(+,+)', '(+,-)'), col = 'brown')
text(x = 80, y=20, label = '(sign of (x-mean(x)), sign of (y-mean(y))', col = 'brown')
```


-------- 

For the two variables that we plotted above the correlation between `Wind Speed` and the `Maximum Temperature` is `r round(cor(airquality$Wind, x=airquality$Tem), digit = 2)`.


-------- 


Note that both cor(x, y) and cor(y, x) give you the same value.

-------- 

```{r}
cor(t.ship.complete$SibSp+t.ship.complete$Parch,
     t.ship.complete$grp.member.ct)
```

--------

However, no *linear* association is not the same as no association; for example,
```{r}
# <center>![Correlation](/Users/daisyhuang/Documents/Teaching/SML201_Fall2018/Lectures/EDA/EDA_part_II/Correlation_examples2.png)</center>
```

# Technical details related to concepts and functions covered in this chapter


We learnt in last chapter the different data types in R: integer, numeric, logical, character/string, factor and complex.

We also learnt two object types in R: vector and data frame.  Recall that a data frame can have entries with different data types whereas a vector has to have homogeneous data type.  It turns out that vectors and data frames are from different groups of objects in R.  

**Two main classes of objects in R**:

* With homogeneous elements: Vectors, matrices, arrays.
* With heterogeneous elements: Lists, data frames.

## Examples of different R objects

**Vector**

Please see previous chapter for examples of vectors.


**Matrix-- a "vector" with 2-dimensional shape**

```{r}
x2 = matrix(1:6, nrow=3, ncol=2)
class(x2)
is.vector(x2)
# Prefix `is.` to any object type name will 
# give you a function that checks whether the 
# input is of the particular data type
is.data.frame(x2)
is.matrix(x2)
dim(x2)
length(x2)

```


 

**Array--a "vector" with 3 or more dimensional shape**

```{r}
x3 = array(1:24, c(2,3,4))
x3
# 4 blocks of matrices, each of size 2x3.
```

**List--can contains elements of *different* data types**

```{r}
mylist = list(elt1=3:9, elt2 = c(2.3, 1.5), elt3 = c('a', 'zz'),
              elt4=matrix(1:4, ncol=2))
mylist # you can have whatever you like for the elements on a list
class(mylist)
```


 

**Data.frame--a special type of list which contains variables of the same number of rows**

```{r}
?data.frame # see the definition of a data.frame in the "details" section

dat = data.frame(ind = 1:4, 
                 temperature = c(73.2, 75.6, 81.1, 89),
                 greater.than.86 = (c(73.2, 75.6, 81.1, 89)>86),
                 hot = c('No', 'No', 'No', 'Yes'))
dat
class(dat)                 
```

Often time data frames can be manipulated in similar ways as for matrices and lists.  However, it is important to understand that data frame is a very different object type from matrix.

### Changing the data type of a vector

Note that for the three R objects above their elements always have the same data type. You can use the functions `as._data type_()` to change the data type of the elements in these R objects.  Why do we want to change the data type of the elements in a R object?  Having the appropriate data type allows R to extract the relevant information; e.g.,


```{r}
str(t.ship, strict.width = 'cut')
# currently `t.ship$Pclass` is an integer vector; thus
# when we apply the `summary()` function to 
# `t.ship$Pclass` we have

summary(t.ship$Pclass)

# however, if we tell R that the elements in
# `t.ship$Pclass` actually represent categories we have

summary(as.factor(t.ship$Pclass))
# which data type is more appropriate here?


```

We already talked about construction, concatenation, extraction and assignment for vectors and data frames; here we are going to talk about these techniques for other R objects.

### Construction, concatenation, extraction and assignment for some R objects

**Matrices**

You can create a matrix in R using the matrix function. 
```{r}
m = matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3) 
# By default matrices are fille by column in R.
m


m <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
# You can change the assignment order by rows.
m
```

You can **assign** names to the rows and columns

```{r}
rownames(m) = c('r1', 'r2')
colnames(m) = c('c1', 'c2', 'c3')
m
```

To **index** elements of a matrix, use the same **five methods of indexing that we have for vectors** but with the first index for rows and the second for columns.

```{r}
m[-1, 2]  # Exclusion and inclusion by position
m["r1",]  # By name, also empty index means "all"
m["r1", c("c1", "c2")]
m[, c(T, T, F)]  
# Empty row index means taking all the rows
# logical column index (note: you will 
# need to have the same number of index as the number of columns)

# What happens if we run
m[, c(T, F)]
m
```


You can **combine** multiple matrices together

```{r}
m
m2 = matrix(11:16, ncol=3)
m2

cbind(m, m2) # combine 2 matrices side by side by columns

rbind(m, m2) # stack 2 matrices by rows

```

Aside: To get more info on your matrix you can use these functions that you already leant for data frames:

```{r}
dim(m)  # The size of m
nrow(m) # The number of rows in m
ncol(m)  # The number of columns in m
```

The functions above also can be used for data frames.   

You can also take the transpose of your matrix this way

```{r}
t(m)    # Transpose of m
```

If you apply `t()` to a data frame `R` will coerce the data frame into a matrix first and you might get unexpected results.


**Array** -- we can generalize the rules for vectors to arrays

An array is like a matrix, but with arbitrary dimension. The first argument is still a vector of elements to fill the array, but the second argument is a vector of sizes in each dimension

```{r}
ar  = array(1:24, dim = c(2, 3, 4)) # A 3-D array
ar
ar[, , 1] # extracting out the 1st block
ar
ar[2, , 3:4] # extracting out the 2nd row of the 3rd and 4th block
ar
ar[1:2, 2:3, 3:4] # extracting out the first 2 rows and 
# the 2nd and 3th columns of block 3 and 4

```

We will not use arrays much in this class.  

**List and data frame** 

In terms of *element data types* data frames and lists are in the same group.  Recall that a data frame is just a special case of a list: all the elements on a data frame need to be of the same length while elements of a list can be of various length.

In terms of *structures* data frames and matrices are in the same group and vectors and lists are in another group.

Compare a data frame with a matrix: Both have a similar structure; however, the columns (i.e., the elements) of a data frame can have different data types whereas the columns of a matrix have to be of the same data type.

Similarly, vectors and lists have a similar structure; however, the elements of a list can have different data types whereas that of a vector have to be of the same data type.

```{r}
d = data.frame(let = c('a', 'p'), val = 1:2, 
               t = c(7.6, 5.1))

d
names(d)  # names of the elements of a data frame
colnames(d) # Remember that this also works for a matrix
```



### Indexing, extraction and concatenation

**Data frame (this part is a review)**

You can index a data frame with all the ways that work for matrices. However, different extraction method might give you an output of different data type. In addition, you can extract a column by name using the $ symbol.

```{r}
class(d$val) # a vector
class(d[[2]]) # a vector
class(d[, 2]) # a vector
class(d[2]) # a data frame

# Note that it makes sense to do this
class(d[2:3])
# but not this
# class(d[[2:3]])
# see details here (https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-lang.html#Indexing)
```

To combine multiple data frames we use the `data.frame()` function


```{r}
# create another data frame to combine with d
d2 = data.frame(let2 = c('k', 'j'), val2 = 8:7)
d2

# combine two data frames

data.frame(d, d2)
class(data.frame(d, d2)) # result is another data frame

cbind(d, d2)   
class(cbind(d, d2)) 
```

**List**

```{r}
ingredients <- list(cheese = c("Cheddar", "Swiss", "Brie"),
      meat = c("Ham","Turkey"))
ingredients

ingredients$meat # Lists can be indexed by name, using $.
class(ingredients$meat)
ingredients[2]  
# can also be indexed like vectors, using []. 
# The result will be another list.
ingredients[[2]] 
# can also extract individual elements of a list by using [[]];
# recall the analogy of taking the R object out of a bag
```

To combine multiple lists we use the `c()` function

```{r}
ingredients2 = list(veggies = c('lettuce', 'tomato'))

c(ingredients, ingredients2)

# What happens if you use `list()` instead?
list(ingredients, ingredients2)

```


Let's try out some exercises
```{r}
head(airquality, n=8)
dim(airquality)
airquality[2,3]
head(airquality$Wind)
head(airquality[,3]) # same column of the dataset
# how many pairs of elements on these two vectors are unequal?
sum(airquality$Wind!=airquality[,3]) 
```

 

## Summary: The types of R object and how to index them: 

```{r eval = F}
## Below are some examples; do not run them since you will need to 
## create the objects for each of the types first

## Vectors: [index]
x[1:4]; x[-3]; x[x>3]

## Matrices: [rowindex, colindex]
m[1,2]; m[1:2, ]; m[, m[1,] >=2 ]; m['r1', ] 
# here 'r1' is the row name for the first row of m

## Arrays: [index1, index2, ..., indexK]
a[1, 3, ]; a[a>=6]

## Data frames: [rowindex, colindex], $name
cars$price; cars[,3:4]; 
cars[cars$passengers == 5, ]

## Lists: $name, [index], [[index]]
ingredients$meat; ingredients[1:2]; ingredients[[1]]

## Note: both $ and [[]] can index only one element.
```




## Some built-in functions in R

-------- 


Before talking about `tapply()` and `table()` we should get ourselves familiar with the data type `factor`. Factors in R are categorical variables.  


For example, I have 8 patients, some of them are in a control group whereas other ones are in a treatment group.  I can create a vector `grp` that gives the group labels of these patients.

```{r}
grp = factor(rep(c("Control", "Treatment"), each = 4))

```

-------- 

```{r}
grp
```

Now I know that the first 4 patients are in the control group and the last 4 are in the treatment group.  Note that a factor vector is interpreted differently by R than a character vector; in our case `Control` and `Treatment` in `grp` are categories, not characters.

-------- 

**tapply()**
 
The `tapply()` function allows us to apply a function to different parts of a vector, where the parts are indexed by a factor or a list of factors. 

Single factor:
```{r}

effect = rnorm(8) # Generate some fake data
effect

?tapply
tapply(X = effect, INDEX = grp, FUN = mean)
# `X` is the vector that you want to apply `FUN` to;
# `INDEX` is the vector used to subset `X`

-------- 

Multiple factors:
```{r}
sex = factor(rep(c("Female", "Male"), times = 4))
sex

tapply(effect, INDEX = list(grp, sex), FUN = mean)

# Here tapply evaluates mean(effect) on every 
# group with  unique combination of (grp, sex).
```

-------- 

When using the `tapply()` function, you can include additional arguments for the function that you supply to `FUN` in the following way.

Let's say that there are some NAs in the vector effect.

```{r}
effect.with.NAs = effect
effect.with.NAs[c(2, 5)] = NA
effect.with.NAs
```

This will just give us NA outputs because `R` does not know how we would want to deal with the `NA`s.

```{r}
tapply(effect.with.NAs, INDEX = grp, FUN = mean)

```


Recall that `na.rm` is an input argument for `mean()`.  We can set `na.rm = T` for `mean()` this way.

```{r}
tapply(effect.with.NAs, INDEX = grp, FUN = mean, na.rm = T)
```




-------- 

The **table()** function uses the cross-classifying factors to build a contingency table of the counts at each combination of factor levels.

```{r}
grp

table(grp)  
# counts how many elements you have in each group
```

`table()` is just a special case of `tapply()`.

```{r}

tapply(rep(1, times =length(grp)), INDEX = grp, FUN = sum)
# same result as above
```

-------- 

**A word of caution**: the outputs of `table()` and `tapply()` are often arrays.  However, a lot of functions often require their input arguments to be vectors.  To convert an array into a vector we can use the `as.vector()` function.  However, `as.vector()` strips the element names of its input by default.  Therefore, we have to assign the names back to the vector. Here is an example

```{r}
grp.table  = table(grp)
class(grp.table)
?table
# an object of class "table" is an array 
# of integer values
grp.table
as.vector(grp.table) # element names were
# stripped

v.grp.table = as.vector(grp.table)
# assign element names back to the vector
names(v.grp.table) = names(grp.table)
```




**`merge()`**


```{r}
# create data for the example
authors <- data.frame(
    surname = I(c("Tukey", "Venables", "Tierney", "Ripley", "McNeil")),
    nationality = c("US", "Australia", "US", "UK", "Australia"),
    deceased = c("yes", rep("no", 4)))

books <- data.frame(
    name = I(c("Tukey", "Venables", "Tierney",
             "Ripley", "Ripley", "McNeil", "R Core")),
    title = c("Exploratory Data Analysis",
              "Modern Applied Statistics ...",
              "LISP-STAT",
              "Spatial Statistics", "Stochastic Simulation",
              "Interactive Data Analysis",
              "An Introduction to R"),
    other.author = c(NA, "Ripley", NA, NA, NA, NA,
                     "Venables & Smith"))
```

---------



```{r}
authors
books
```



-----------

```{r}

# which data frame goes first
# if the variable for joining has different names
# the variable name in the data frame for the first input will be used
# Resulting data frame will have the overlap of `authors$surname` & 
# `books$name`
authors.first = merge(x=authors, y=books, 
                      by.x = "surname", by.y = "name")

authors.first
```

-----------

```{r}

books.first = merge(x=books, y=authors,  
                    by.y = "surname", by.x = "name")

books.first
dim(authors)
dim(books)
```

-----------


```{r}
# check to see whether the names are in the same order
# note that the names are character vectors

sum(authors.first$surname != books.first$name)


# note that R Core was dropped since it is not in authors
# To include R Core, we can do a union-join
merge(x = authors, y = books, by.x = "surname", by.y = "name", all = TRUE)
# or do this: a right-join
merge(x = authors, y = books, by.x = "surname", by.y = "name", all.y = TRUE)


```

-----------

**`mutate()`**

`mutate()` in the `dplyr` package adds new variables to the input of the function and preserves existing variables; `mutate()` is a convenient function to use when you want to add new columns to an existing data frame.

-----------

```{r}
# create variables to make a data frame
a =c('category I', 'category II')
a
m = matrix(1:6, ncol=3)
m
```


```{r}
library('dplyr')
d = data.frame(a, m)
d
# adding two new columns to d
new.d = mutate(d, X1minusX2 = X1-X2, X2overX3 = X2/X3)
new.d
```

```{r}
class(new.d) #mutate preserve the object class
str(new.d)
```

-----------

This is the same as
```{r}

new.d2 = data.frame(d, X1minusX2 = d$X1-d$X2, X2overX3 = d$X2/d$X3)
new.d2
```

However, by default `data.frame()` will automatically convert all the character vector columns to factor vectors; thus, oftentimes it is better to use `mutate()` than `data.frame()`.

## using `boxplot()` on a matrix

The function `boxplot()` can be used on a matrix to make multiple boxplots, one for each column of a matrix.  For example, here we have four columns of a matrix that list the sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 150 iris.

```{r}
flower.part.measurements = as.matrix(iris[, 1:4])
head(flower.part.measurements)
```

We can make four boxplots, one for each column of the matrix.

```{r}
boxplot(flower.part.measurements, ylab = 'measurements (cm)',
        main = 'Distributions of iris part measurements')
```

## Anatomy of a function

The syntax for writing a function is

>function(input_argument_list){body}

* The keyword `function` just tells R that you want to create a function.
* The arguments to a function are its inputs, which may have default values.
* Next we have the body of the function, which typically consists of expressions surrounded by curly brackets. Think of these as performing some operations on the input values given by the arguments.



--------


Typically we assign the **function** to a particular **name**. This should describe what the function does.

>MyFunction = function(input_argument_list){body}

A function without a name is called an *orphan* function. These can be very powerfully used with the apply mechanism. Stay tuned....
  
```{r}
Square = function(x){return(x^2)}
```


--------


  
the **body of the function**, which typically consists of expressions surrounded by curly brackets. Think of these as performing some operations on the input values given by the arguments.

>{
>    expression 1  
>    expression 2  
>    return(value)  
>}



--------


The **return** expression controls the values that you want to output. If the function
returns more than one thing, this is done using a named list, for example
return(list(total = sum(x), avg = mean(x))).

In the **absence of a return expression**, a function will return the last evaluated expression. This is particularly common if the function is short.
  
For example, I could write the simple function:

>MyMean = function(x) sum(x)/length(x)

Here I don’t even need brackets {}, since there is only
one expression.

--------

Below is another example of a function. This function extracts out the most popular name for a given year and a given gender.

```{r}
library(babynames)

popular.name = function(year, gender){
  #  year needs to be numeric 
  # `gender` need to be a character vector of length one

  baby.year = babynames[babynames$year == year & babynames$sex == gender,]
  return(baby.year$name[baby.year$n == max(baby.year$n)])
}

popular.name(year = 2010, gender = "F")
```

--------


A return expression anywhere in the function will cause the function to return control to the user immediately, without evaluating the rest of the function. 

You will make a function to carry out these three steps for any data frame `d` in this week's precept.



```{r eval=F}
dim(d)
class(d)
summary(d)
```
